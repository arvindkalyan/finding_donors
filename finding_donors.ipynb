    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Decision Trees**\n",
    "\n",
    "Real World Application: Decision trees are used in operations research to figure out what methods are best equipped to create a solution (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree). \n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths: Decision trees are remarkably simple, using an intuitive tree model and a series of logical progressions in order to classify and predict data. They are very intuitive, allowing us to lay out all the possible options and routes through which a datapoint can go. \n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses: Decision trees are very prone to overfitting, and changes in data can lead to large changes in the tree structure and the model's sucess as a whole. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fit: A decision tree would be a good fit for this problem since it involves a binary classification to model the income of the donors, but since there are a large number of features, it may prove to be too complicated for the decision tree. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Ensemble Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "Real World Application: Ensemble methods may be used to detect patterns in face recognition and can be applied to areas including object tracking as well. (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/296342438_Ensemble_machine_learning_Methods_and_applications)\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths: Ensemble methods allow for the creation of complex models, since they rarely overfit, and give back good accuracy with the test results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses: That being said, ensemble methods perform poorly with outliers in the data set, and can take up a lot, in terms of both time and memory consumption, with large, feature-filled datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fit: Ensemble methods would be useful for us, since there is a pretty clean dataset with few outliers, and would be able to handle a large number of features due to its ability to create complex models. That being said, if time was a factor, it may deter us from using an ensemble method. \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. SVM**\n",
    "\n",
    "Real World Application: SVMs have been used as part of face detection algorithms, classifying various parts of the face, allowing square boundaries to be created. This seems to be one of the major components in the concept of Computer Vision (https://data-flair.training/blogs/applications-of-svm/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths: SVMs are good with classifying against many features, allowing us to create a complex model that can take in a multi-dimensional dataset and provide accurate predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses: SVMs are often very slow in terms of their run time, and with a larger model, they could take an even more unwieldy time to run. They can also be big on memory consumption, to an extent even greater than the Ensemble methods previously discussed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fit: SVMs would be a good fit since our data is complex, with a large number of dimensions, but since they take up a lot of time, there may be more effective solutions out there that can provide some of the same multi-dimensional ability while running in a feasible time. \n",

    "Based off our testing and training data, we would recommend using the AdaBoostClassifier Ensemble Method to identify individuals with an income over 50k. In each of the testing sets, using 1%, 10%, and 100% of the total training sample size, we had a higher accuracy using the AdaBoostClassifier than both SVC and Decision Tree Classifier, at over 0.8 on each instance. Its F-Score, using 100% of the training data, was also higher than the other two models we tested- the SVC didn't even have one. It also had the fastest time to train and make predictions, especially when compared to the extravagant testing time taken by the SVC. The Decision Tree classifier was solid, but overfitted, with a better performance on the training set than the test. This leaves the AdaBoosterClassifier, which was able to succeed in this example as it is expected to do on binary classifications in general. "

    "The AdaBoost Classifier combines several lesser classifiers together, allowing for a higher accuracy in the composite. In the iteration through several classifiers, they become more powerful, and through the Boost feature, they can decrease bias and overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "A weak learner is an algorithm that is slightly better than guessing randomly, but usually not as powerful as a strong learner. The only qualification for a weak learner is being better than a completely random guess, even in very specific scopes. A learner that is very good at identifying a certain data type and poor with others, for example, is a weak learner. The combination of these learners form an AdaBoost classifier. One popular weak learner is the decision tree- a sort of flowchart in which data passes through a set of classifier questions/nodes- which is easy to combine due to its nonlinearity and is very fast to train and adjust. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, a base classifier is selected to use on the dataset. After fitting onto the data, the AdaBoost classifier checks out its results. Usually, the accuracy of the initial base classifier is not great, and the magnitudes of the errors made on the first pass are noted. Then, with those weights in mind, the AdaBoost classifier applies a copy of the base classifier again to the dataset, tuning the weights as to mitigate the largest errors detected by the previous classifier. In this way, the classifier boosts, combining these weak learners. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these weak learners are weighted to work on the sections of data that best fit their limited scopes. In the combination of classifiers, a higher cumulative weight is assigned to classifiers that do relatively well. A classifier  that has a high accuracy, for example, will be weighted higher when compiling the final model. This process of adding classifiers is then repeated until the errors have been minimized or a set quota of estimators has been reached, creating the final classifier model. In the case of the census data, weak learners that are strong with predictions on certain features and weak on other may be compiled through the aforementioned processes to create a stronger classifier that can be applied to the entire dataset. \n",

    "The top 5 features are capital loss, age, capital gain, hours per week, education num. This compares pretty well to what I had predicted, though I had expected occupation, instead of capital loss. This visualization definitely confirms my thoughts- each factor had a strong impact. The only one I missed was capital loss, which turned out to be the most important feature. This would make sense, since capital loss implies that there is some sort of asset liquidation. Despite the fact that this is a capital LOSS, the fact that there are assets to liquidate probably correlates with a richer individual, who is more likely to possess the assets to sell off in the first place.

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
